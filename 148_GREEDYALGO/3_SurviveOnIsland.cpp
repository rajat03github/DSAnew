/**
 Ishika got stuck on an island. There is only one shop on this island and it is open on all days of the week except for Sunday. Consider following constraints:

N – The maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
S – Number of days you are required to survive.
M – Unit of food required each day to survive.
Currently, it’s Monday, and she needs to survive for the next S days.
Find the minimum number of days on which you need to buy food from the shop so that she can survive the next S days, or determine that it isn’t possible to survive.
